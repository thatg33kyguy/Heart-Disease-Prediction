## ðŸ“– Project Overview  
This project develops a **machine learning model** to predict the risk of heart disease using patient health attributes such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and exercise patterns.  
It demonstrates the end-to-end ML pipeline: **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.**

---

## âœ¨ Features  
- Cleaned and preprocessed the **UCI Heart Disease dataset**.  
- Conducted **EDA** with histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps.  
- Encoded categorical variables and standardized continuous features.  
- Trained a **Logistic Regression classifier** for binary classification.  
- Evaluated model with **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix**.  

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- **Languages/Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  

---

## ðŸ”Ž Workflow  
1. **Preprocessing** â€“ one-hot encoding and feature scaling.  
2. **EDA** â€“ analyzing correlations among health metrics.  
3. **Model Training** â€“ Logistic Regression with 70/30 train-test split.  
4. **Evaluation** â€“ accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.  

---

## ðŸ“Š Results  
- **Training Accuracy:** 86.8%  
- **Testing Accuracy:** 86.8%  
- Strong predictors: **maximum heart rate, cholesterol, blood pressure, exercise-induced angina**.  

---

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements  
- Experiment with models like Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting.  
- Apply hyperparameter tuning for improved performance.  
- Deploy as a web application using Flask or Streamlit.
