# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning  

This project develops a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on clinical attributes such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and exercise patterns.  
It demonstrates the complete ML pipeline: data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, and performance evaluation.  

---

## Features  
- Preprocessed and cleaned the **UCI Heart Disease dataset**.  
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations including histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps.  
- Applied one-hot encoding for categorical variables and standardized continuous features.  
- Implemented a Logistic Regression classifier for binary classification (disease vs. no disease).  
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## Tech Stack  
- **Languages/Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  

---

## Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing** – categorical encoding and feature scaling.  
2. **EDA** – analysis of correlations between health metrics and heart disease.  
3. **Model Training** – Logistic Regression applied with a 70/30 train-test split.  
4. **Evaluation** – performance measured with classification metrics and confusion matrix.

## Results  
- Achieved approximately **X% accuracy** on the test set using Logistic Regression.  
- Key predictors identified include maximum heart rate, cholesterol, blood pressure, and exercise-induced angina.

## Future Work  
- Compare performance with other algorithms such as Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting.  
- Apply hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.  
- Deploy as a web application using Flask or Streamlit.
