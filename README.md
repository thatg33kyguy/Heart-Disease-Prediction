# Heart-disease-prediction# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning  

A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on clinical attributes such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and exercise patterns.  
The project applies supervised learning techniques, performs exploratory analysis, and evaluates model performance using multiple metrics.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Preprocessed and cleaned the **UCI Heart Disease dataset**.  
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) with histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps.  
- Applied **one-hot encoding** for categorical variables and standardized continuous features.  
- Trained a **Logistic Regression classifier** for binary classification (disease vs. no disease).  
- Evaluated performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Languages/Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## 📊 Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing** – handled categorical encoding and feature scaling.  
2. **EDA** – identified correlations between age, max heart rate, cholesterol, and disease risk.  
3. **Model Training** – Logistic Regression applied on training/test splits (70/30).  
4. **Evaluation** – measured Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
